# mySqlmapp - base on sqlmap and scan task manager web ui Injection Scanner

mySqlmapp is a forked and modified version of sqlmap, a popular SQL injection scanner. This fork aims to enhance the functionality of sqlmap by adding web-based task management capabilities. It allows users to manage their scanning tasks directly through a web interface, providing features such as task activation, pausing, termination, and deletion. Additionally, users can view task logs, identify injection points, and easily access payload details.

We have also developed a Java-based Burp Suite client plugin that simplifies the process of submitting scanning tasks. This plugin seamlessly integrates with Burp Suite, enabling users to submit tasks directly from within the application.

## Features

- Web-based task management: Easily manage SQL injection scanning tasks through a user-friendly web interface.
- Task control: Start, pause, terminate, and delete scanning tasks as needed.
- Task logs: View detailed logs for each scanning task, allowing for effective troubleshooting and analysis.
- Injection point identification: Clearly identify injection points in the scanned application.
- Payload details: Conveniently access and review payload details for each injection point.
- Burp Suite integration: Utilize our Java-based Burp Suite client plugin to streamline the submission of scanning tasks.
